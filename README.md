Good day ˚˖𓍢ִ໋🌷͙֒✧˚.🎀༘⋆  
This is a calender website I built to show off the skills I have learnt in JavaScript so far 

I already have basic knowledge about date set and get method

I went on the internet; Google, and I came to a website called w3schools that gives code syntax like
const d = new Date("2015-03");
getFullYear()	Get year as a four digit number (yyyy)
getMonth()	Get month as a number (0-11)
getDate()	Get day as a number (1-31)
getDay()	Get weekday as a number (0-6)
getHours()	Get hour (0-23)
getMinutes()	Get minute (0-59)
getSeconds()	Get second (0-59)
getMilliseconds()	Get millisecond (0-999)
getTime()	Get time (milliseconds since January 1, 1970)

They guided me in building this mini project 

I would love to hear about what you think concerning this project

I also hope I deploy more JavaScript projects in the future : )
